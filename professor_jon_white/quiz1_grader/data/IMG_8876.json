  "answer_text": "Isaac Rankin\n\n- A turing machine is a device that inputs ticker tape and performs an operation using the instructions set in the tape. Turing machines are important because they are the basis of programming languages.\n\n- A programming language is turing complete if it can take input, perform an operation, and output the result,\n\n- A turing-complete language is Python and a non turing complete language is html",

    "question_1": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You recognized the tape and that the machine follows instructions\u2014good start. A complete definition should note it is an abstract model with an infinite tape, a read/write head, and a finite set of states (the control)."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "Partial. You mention it performs operations from instructions, but you didn\u2019t describe how: at each step it reads a symbol, uses a transition to write a symbol, move the head left/right, and change state until halting."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You correctly point to its foundational role. To earn full credit, mention that Turing Machines define computability and decidability, expose limits like the Halting Problem, and show why different programming models have the same power."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "This definition is not correct. Many non\u2013Turing-complete systems can take input, compute, and output. Turing complete means a language can simulate a Turing Machine\u2014i.e., it has unbounded memory and supports general looping/recursion to perform any computable function (given enough time/memory)."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Good examples: Python is Turing complete; HTML is not. You could also cite C/JavaScript (TC) and regular expressions or basic SQL/HTML/CSS (non-TC) for breadth."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_feedback": "Isaac, you show a solid intuition that Turing Machines and Turing completeness underpin programming languages, and your examples were on point. To reach full mastery, tighten the formal pieces: describe the TM mechanics (tape, head, states, transitions) and refine your definition of Turing completeness around simulating a TM via unbounded memory plus looping/recursion. You\u2019re close\u2014add those details and you\u2019ll have a strong, industry-ready explanation.",
