  "answer_text": "A Turing Machine is a process that exposes if something is computer or human. It takes a human through a series of answers and the human must guess which answer was [from] generated by a computer. It is important in computer science because it shows the problem solving skills of a computer and how they operate. Programming languages that are \"Turing Complete\" involve being able to process data. This involves code being able to gather user data and Non Turing Complete is code that doesn't really gather information.",

      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "This defines the Turing Test, not a Turing Machine. A Turing Machine is an abstract computational model with an infinite tape, a read/write head, and a finite set of states and transition rules."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "You described a human judging conversation (the Turing Test). How a Turing Machine works: it reads a symbol on the tape, consults its current state, writes a symbol, moves the head left or right, and changes state according to a transition function."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You spoke to importance in a general sense (problem-solving skills), but tied it to the Turing Test. The importance of Turing Machines is that they formalize what computation is, define computability and decidability, and reveal limits like the Halting Problem."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "Turing completeness is not about gathering user data. A language is Turing Complete if it can simulate a universal Turing Machine\u2014i.e., given enough time and memory, it can perform any computation (typically requires conditional branching and unbounded loops/recursion)."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "No examples were provided. Examples of Turing Complete languages: C, Python, JavaScript. Examples of non\u2013Turing complete languages/notations: HTML, CSS, regular expressions without backreferences, and basic SQL (without recursion)."

  "total_score": 10,
  "overall_feedback": "Kaleb, I appreciate your effort and the clear writing style. However, you conflated the Turing Machine with the Turing Test. The Turing Machine is a theoretical model of computation (tape, head, states), while the Turing Test is about indistinguishability of machine vs. human behavior. Review the mechanics of a Turing Machine and the definition of Turing completeness (ability to simulate a universal TM). Next time, include concrete examples. You\u2019re thinking about why these ideas matter\u2014let\u2019s channel that into the precise CS definitions. You\u2019ve got this!",
