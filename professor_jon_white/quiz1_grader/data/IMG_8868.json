    "question_1": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "This defines a virtual machine, not a Turing Machine. A Turing Machine is a mathematical model of computation consisting of an infinite tape, a read/write head, a finite set of states, and a transition function."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "Your description reflects compiling and running programs, not the TM mechanics. A TM repeatedly reads a tape symbol, writes a symbol, moves the head left or right, and changes state according to its transition function, halting when it reaches a halting state."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "Importance is not about providing a coding environment. TMs matter because they characterize what is computable (Church\u2013Turing thesis), let us reason about decidability/undecidability (e.g., the Halting Problem), and underpin complexity theory and language design."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "Turing completeness is not about producing output in a VM. A language is Turing Complete if it can simulate a Turing Machine (informally: has conditional branching and unbounded memory/loops or recursion)."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You provided examples in both categories. C++, Java, and Python are Turing Complete; HTML/CSS are typically non\u2013Turing complete. However, Go (Golang) is Turing Complete, so listing it as non\u2013Turing is incorrect. \"ROS+\" is unclear. Additional correct non\u2013TC examples: JSON, regular expressions without backreferences."

  "total_score": 10,
  "overall_feedback": "Kayla, I appreciate the effort and the organization of your answer. However, the core concepts were conflated with virtual machines and compilation. Please revisit Turing Machines as a simple but powerful mathematical model (tape, head, states, transition function) and why they matter for computability and decidability. Also refine your understanding of Turing completeness and examples\u2014Go is Turing complete; HTML/CSS are not. With these corrections, you\u2019ll have a strong foundation for reasoning about what programs and languages can and cannot do.",
