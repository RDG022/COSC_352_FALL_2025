  "answer_text": "1) A turning machine is the process in what the computer interprets the code more so of a theoretical way or process to interpret code you can use the turning machine to see how efficient a program may run.\n\nExample of what the diagram maybe.\n\nin a turning machine. You may input the following \"111 + 11 but the computer may interpet it as 5.\n\nExamples of Turning\n- java\n- Ruby\n- c++\n\nExamples of non Turning\n- css\n- html\n\n3) To call a programming language turning complete means it can be used to save any problem using like object orented programming, data stuctures; within non Turning like css this is used for one specific part of code You can not use this to save multiple problems.",

      "feedback": "You recognize that a Turing Machine is a theoretical model of computation, which is a good start. However, it\u2019s not primarily about program efficiency. A Turing Machine is an abstract machine with a finite set of states that operates on an infinite tape of symbols."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You hinted at states and gave an example, but you didn\u2019t describe the mechanism: a read/write head scans a tape cell, follows a transition function (based on current state and symbol) to write a symbol, move left/right, and change state. More detail here would complete the picture."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The importance was not accurately explained. Turing Machines matter because they define what is computable, underpin the Church\u2013Turing thesis, and let us reason about decidability/undecidability (e.g., the Halting Problem)\u2014not to measure efficiency."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You captured the intuition that a Turing-complete language can solve any (computable) problem, but tied it incorrectly to OOP/data structures. More precisely, a language is Turing complete if it can simulate a Turing Machine\u2014typically by supporting conditional branching and unbounded iteration/recursion given enough time and memory."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Good examples. Java, Ruby, and C++ are Turing complete. HTML and CSS (by themselves, without scripting) are not. Nice job giving both sides."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_feedback": "You show early intuition that Turing Machines are theoretical models and provided solid examples of Turing-complete vs. non\u2013Turing-complete languages. To grow, focus on the precise mechanics (tape, head, states, transition function) and why Turing Machines are foundational: they define the limits of computation. Clarify that Turing completeness is about the ability to simulate a Turing Machine, independent of paradigms like OOP. You\u2019re on the right track\u2014tighten the definitions and your explanations will be much stronger.",
