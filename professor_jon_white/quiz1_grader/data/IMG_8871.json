  "answer_text": "Turing Machine is a system or machine developed by Alan Turing. It was engineered to intercept communication of the Germans during the World War. It is the fundamental building block for modern day computers.\n\n- It operates with ip inputs, phases and outputs.\n- The phase operation are dependent on different parameters such as \u03b1, \u03b2 and T.\n- It processes data into meaningful information.\n\nTuring complete language means that input is explicitly typed or defined. eg C++\n\nNon turing complete language means data is not strict on being defined eg Python.",

      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You identified Alan Turing and hinted at foundational significance, which is good. However, a Turing Machine is not a wartime device; it is an abstract mathematical model of computation (infinite tape, read/write head, set of states). The WWII codebreaking machines were different (e.g., the Bombe). Define it explicitly as an abstract model next time."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "This section doesn\u2019t describe the actual mechanics. A Turing Machine has a tape divided into cells, a head that reads/writes symbols, a finite set of states, and a transition function that dictates writing a symbol, moving L/R, and changing state until halting. Terms like \u201cphases\u201d and Greek parameters aren\u2019t part of the standard model."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You noted it as foundational, which is on the right track. To fully earn credit, explain why: Turing Machines define the limits of what is computable, underpin decidability results (e.g., the Halting Problem), and provide a unifying model for languages and architectures."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "Turing completeness is not about types. A language is Turing Complete if it can simulate a Turing Machine\u2014practically, if it supports unbounded memory and general control flow (loops/recursion and conditionals)."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "C++ is a valid Turing-complete example. However, Python is also Turing complete, so it\u2019s not a correct example of a non\u2013Turing-complete language. Non-TC examples include HTML/CSS, basic regular expressions (without backreferences), or strictly total languages without general recursion."

  "total_score": 30,
  "overall_feedback": "I appreciate your effort and your recognition that Turing\u2019s work is foundational. However, several key concepts were mixed up. Focus on the Turing Machine as an abstract model with tape, head, states, and a transition function, and connect its importance to computability and decidability. For Turing completeness, remember it\u2019s about the ability to simulate a Turing Machine (not typing). Review correct examples: C/C++/Java/Python are Turing complete; HTML/CSS or basic regex are not. You\u2019re asking the right questions\u2014tighten the definitions and mechanics, and you\u2019ll make a big leap.",
