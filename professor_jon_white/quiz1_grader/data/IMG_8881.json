  "answer_text": "1) A Turing machine is the process in what the computer interprets the code more so of a theoretical way or process to interpret code you are use the Turing machine to see how efficient a program may run.\n\n[small state diagram sketch]\nExample of what the diagram may be\n\nin a Turing machine you may input the following \"111 + 11\" but the computer may interpret it as 5.\n\n2) Examples of Turing\n- java\n- Ruby\n- c++\nExamples of non Turing\n- css\n- html\n\n3) To call a programming language Turing complete means it can be used to solve any problem using like object oriented programming, data structures, within non Turing. Like css this is used for one specific part of code you can not use this to solve multiple problems.",

      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You recognized that a Turing machine is a theoretical concept, which is an important start. However, it is not a process for measuring program efficiency. A Turing machine is a formal model of computation consisting of an infinite tape, a read/write head, a finite set of states, and a transition function."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "This part did not explain the mechanism. To earn full credit, describe how the head reads a symbol, consults the current state, writes a symbol, moves left or right, and changes state according to a transition function. The example \"111 + 11 -> 5\" is not correct as stated; in unary, 111 + 11 would result in 11111 (five 1s), not the numeral 5."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The response did not address why Turing machines matter. They are foundational because they define what is computable (Church\u2013Turing thesis), help classify decidable vs. undecidable problems (e.g., the Halting Problem), and provide a basis for language and compiler theory."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You conveyed the general idea that a Turing-complete language can solve any problem, but the precise meaning is: it can simulate a Turing machine (i.e., compute any computable function), typically requiring unbounded memory and the ability to perform conditional branching and unbounded loops/recursion. It is not about being object-oriented or having data structures specifically."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Good list. Java, Ruby, and C++ are Turing-complete; HTML and CSS (in their usual forms) are not. For context, other TC examples include Python and JavaScript; non-TC examples include JSON, Markdown, and basic regular expressions."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 40,
  "overall_feedback": "Minya, I appreciate your effort and the recognition that Turing machines are theoretical. To strengthen your understanding, focus on the concrete mechanics: an infinite tape, a read/write head, states, and a transition function. Practice explaining why this model matters (what is computable, limits like the Halting Problem). Your examples of TC vs. non-TC languages were solid\u2014nice work there. Tighten the definition of Turing completeness and avoid tying it to OOP. With clearer, more precise explanations, you\u2019ll be in great shape.",
