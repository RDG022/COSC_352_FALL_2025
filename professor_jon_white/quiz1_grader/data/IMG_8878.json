  "answer_text": "Turing machine was invented by Alen Turing. It is a powerful way to process how computers process information & solves the problem given to them by the users. It is more of an abstract idea or a concept to understand computation.\nTuring machine consists of infinite tape which is divided into cells with 0s & 1s which works like a memory or storage to store various computational data. It has tape that moves from left to right then a cell to read & write symbols on tape. It also has a finite number of states including start state. Turing machine has a transition function to let machine know what & how to act depending on the current state & symbol of the tape. It provides a new symbol to write, the guiding direction of the next state.\nIt is important to understand the foundation of computation, it also defines computability & also was a base for various more universal computers. It is considered as base for modern programmable computers.\nTo be turing complete, the computer must function simulate turing machine. If can perform computation & given enough time & storage & also implement any algorithm.\nExample: Python, Java, C++ etc.\nThey not turing complete if they can't perform basic computation.\nExample: CSS, HTML.",

    "question_1": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Clear definition: you recognized a Turing Machine as an abstract model of computation introduced by Turing to reason about solving problems. Nice job framing it as a conceptual foundation."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Strong operational description: tape, cells, read/write head, finite states, and a transition function. Minor notes: the tape alphabet isn\u2019t limited to just 0/1, and the head moves left or right (not only left-to-right). Otherwise solid."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Excellent: you tied TMs to the foundations of computability and modern computers, explaining why they matter for defining what can be computed."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Correct: Turing completeness means being able to simulate a Turing Machine (i.e., compute any computable function given enough time and unbounded memory). Good connection to implementing any algorithm."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Correct examples: Python/Java/C++ are Turing complete; HTML/CSS are not (without scripting). Well chosen."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 100,
  "overall_feedback": "Amit, this is a thoughtful, well-structured answer that shows strong conceptual understanding. You accurately described what a Turing Machine is, how it operates, and why it anchors computability in CS, and you provided correct examples of Turing-complete and non\u2013Turing-complete languages. Small refinements: note that the tape alphabet can be any finite set of symbols (not just 0/1), and the head can move left or right. Keep up the excellent clarity and attention to fundamentals.",
