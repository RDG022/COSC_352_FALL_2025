  "answer_text": "A turing machine is a process used to breakdown and implement the logic to a problem involving computer science or programming languages. A programming language is \"Turing complete\" when we can basically break down and solve any problem or scenario in it using turing logic. (Using true/false or 1's and 0's). An example of a turing complete language could be Python, and a non turing complete language could be Java.",

    "question_1": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You recognized that a Turing Machine is connected to problem solving and logic, which is a start. However, a Turing Machine is specifically a formal model of computation consisting of an infinite tape, a read/write head, a finite set of states, and a transition function. Naming those pieces would make this fully correct."
    },
    "question_2": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "You didn\u2019t explain the mechanism. A complete answer would describe how the head reads a symbol, uses the current state and symbol to decide to write a symbol, move left or right on the tape, change state, and either continue or halt."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You hinted at importance through problem solving, but the key reasons are missing: TMs define the limits of what\u2019s computable (decidability), underpin the Church\u2013Turing Thesis, and give us a yardstick to compare languages and systems. Mentioning these would strengthen your answer."
    },
    "question_4": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "You conveyed that Turing completeness relates to being able to solve very general problems, which is partially right. More precisely, a language is Turing Complete if it can simulate a Turing Machine (typically needs conditional branching and unbounded memory). Note: it does not mean it can solve every problem\u2014only every computable one, given enough time and memory."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "Python is a correct example of a Turing-complete language. However, Java is also Turing complete, so it\u2019s not a valid non-TC example. For non\u2013Turing-complete examples, think of languages without unbounded memory or general looping/recursion, such as HTML, CSS, JSON, or regular expressions without backreferences."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 40,
  "overall_feedback": "Marquise, I appreciate your effort to connect Turing Machines to problem solving and your correct identification of Python as Turing complete. To grow further, focus on the concrete model: tape, head, states, and transition rules\u2014how they operate step-by-step\u2014and why that matters for computability and the limits of algorithms. Tighten your definition of Turing completeness and choose examples carefully (Python, Java, C are TC; HTML/CSS/JSON are not). With clearer precision, your conceptual intuition will translate into strong, professional explanations.",
