Also it is important to Compsci Because it was the early form of AI,\n\n2: it means if we was to use a turing machine that the programing language would work with the tuning machine.\n\nTuring complete = python, c/c++\nnon tuning complete = HTML",

      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "Partial credit. You note that a Turing machine reads from a line (tape) and can move back and forth\u2014good start. A complete definition should mention it is an abstract computational model with an (unbounded) tape, a read/write head, a finite set of states, and a transition function."

    "question_2": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "Partial credit. Some mechanics are implied in Q1 (moving along a tape), but you don\u2019t describe the full step-by-step operation: read a symbol, consult the current state and transition rule, optionally write a symbol, move left or right, change state, and halt when appropriate."
    },
    "question_3": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "Partial and somewhat inaccurate. You say it\u2019s important because it was an early form of AI. The key importance is that Turing machines formalize computability (what can/cannot be computed), leading to concepts like decidability and the Church\u2013Turing thesis, which underpin programming languages and the theory of computation."

    "question_4": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "Partial credit. Saying a language would \u201cwork with\u201d a Turing machine is vague. Turing Complete means a language can simulate a Turing machine\u2014i.e., compute any computable function given enough time and unbounded memory (typically requiring conditionals and unbounded loops/recursion)."
    },
    "question_5": {
      "score": 20,
      "feedback": "Full credit. Python and C/C++ are Turing complete; HTML is a good example of a non\u2013Turing-complete language/notation. Nice job providing both categories."

  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_feedback": "Christian, you\u2019ve got the right general picture of a Turing machine moving along a tape, and your examples of Turing-complete versus non-Turing-complete languages are solid. To strengthen your understanding, focus on the formal pieces: states, read/write head, transition function, and halting. Most importantly, connect the significance to computability and limits of computation rather than AI. With those refinements, your explanations will be precise and industry-ready. Keep pushing\u2014you\u2019re close.",
