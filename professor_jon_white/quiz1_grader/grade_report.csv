,,,"A Turing machine is a theoretical model of computation which is used to define what an algorithm is and what it means for a problem to be computable.

How it works: It reads symbols from a single, infinite tape and follows a simple set of rules based on its current state & the symbol it reads, then writes a new symbol and moves left or right and then stops when the job is done

Amit Bhattachari,,,"Turing machine was invented by Alen Turing. It is a powerful way to process how computers process information & solves the problem given to them by the users. It is more of an abstract idea or a concept to understand computation.
Turing machine consists of infinite tape which is divided into cells with 0s & 1s which works like a memory or storage to store various computational data. It has tape that moves from left to right then a cell to read & write symbols on tape. It also has a finite number of states including start state. Turing machine has a transition function to let machine know what & how to act depending on the current state & symbol of the tape. It provides a new symbol to write, the guiding direction of the next state.
It is important to understand the foundation of computation, it also defines computability & also was a base for various more universal computers. It is considered as base for modern programmable computers.
To be turing complete, the computer must function simulate turing machine. If can perform computation & given enough time & storage & also implement any algorithm.
Example: Python, Java, C++ etc.
They not turing complete if they can't perform basic computation.

-> Turing Machine is theoritical model of computation which is used to define what an algorithm is and what it means for a problem to be computable.

Turing machine works like this; it reads symbol from a single line of algorithm and checks the condition based on if else the. if the condition satisfies it moves on to next step/ if false it exits and terminate the process until the end result is obtained.

when a programming language is turing complete it means it's able to define the algorithm and understand the problem behind it and finally make the problem more computable and easier,

Turing Machine is important to computer Science because it helps in interpting the problem much faster and increase the accuracy by making it computable
