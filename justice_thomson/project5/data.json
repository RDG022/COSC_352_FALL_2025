I remember the days when we played in the recreation center, swam in the pool. Enjoyed all the activities that they offered. Our grandmothers scrubbed our porches and steps, our neighbors stuck together and we knew each other. We had a problem with each other we used our hands. After that it was over. Nobody got a weapon because that meant you were a coward and couldn&#8217;t take the beating. You won some and you lost some. But no matter what you went home. The children don&#8217;t understand that they are doing the job of our enemies. When they see black ppl killing each other they&#8217;re happy., see all these people on here and my heart breaks because it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Old and young they just play God and next week it&#8217;s their mom crying. Why? What happened to our beloved city? Baltimore can still be the ice it was full of proud black people. Pray for the people we senselessly lost and the people who lost their loved ones 🤲🏽💜🕊&#65039; 8:55 AM, March 12, 2025 TruthTeller418 said...
