Project 4 
-you are required to use in the Scala programming language which runs on the JVM and submit containerize the program in a docker container.  

-You also need to deliver the project with a shell script (.sh file) called run.sh that successfully runs the Scala program in the the docker container.  If a docker image is not built on the machine then you need to build it in the .sh file.  

-You will get points off it I cannot 'cd' into your project4 directory and build the container.  Hint: You need to build the docker image to run the JVM and compile your Scala program to run in the container. 



Congratulations for making it to Project 4! Pre-requisites for the course should be done now.  The expectation is that you will be using Docker and submitting via Github moving forward.
